Overview

Pytorch code to reproduce the results of the clustring algorithms: Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training with  Virtual Adversarial Training (IMSAT-Vat) and Deep Regularized Information Maximization (Deep_RIM) proposed in [1]. The adoped data set is MNIST. The implementation in [1] is based on Chainer.
